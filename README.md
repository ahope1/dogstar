From CASA ([solutionarchive.com](https://solutionarchive.com/game/id%2C3964/Dog+Star+Adventure.html)):
>Dog Star Adventure is reputed to be the first text adventure to be published in a magazine: the May 1979 issues of SoftSide.
>
>The game is heavily based on Star Wars. As a result of being the first ever published text adventure listing it has been both officially and unofficially ported many times, to multiple machines, often without crediting the original author ... Several of the more common ports of the game also change the title and insert direct references to Star Wars ...

>The game was originally published on tape by TRS-80 Software Exchange for the TRS-80 Model 1 Level II. It was first advertised in SoftSide, vol. 1, no. 7, April 1979 ... It was then published by SoftSide Publications as a BASIC type-in listing for the TRS-80 in SoftSide, vol. 1, no. 8, May 1979

This BBC Micro port was created in 2025. (Specifically, it's a port of the Zenith listing found [at IFDB](https://ifdb.org/viewgame?id=adnqhkzfgrrt5mtv).)

The file ***dogstar.ssd*** is a floppy-disc image file, in Acorn DFS format, which contains a copy of the game and which can be loaded into a BBC Micro emulator such as BeebEm.
